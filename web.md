  # Grid
  
  it makes grids, guy
  
  3x2 grid 2/ widths on columns, heights on rows:
  
  .wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
}

can create cell that aren't filled, they just won't show up until they are

to mess with an individual item:

.item1 {
    grid-column-start: 1; // starts at beginning of column 1
    grid-column-end: 4; // ends at beginning of column 4, which doesn't exist, but represents the end of column 3
}

can also be:

.item1 {
    grid-column: 1 / 4;
}

can be negative indexed too

can also be define as a span:

grid-column-start: 2
grid-column-end: span 2

two cell wide instruction

can declare start a span to start from the end
